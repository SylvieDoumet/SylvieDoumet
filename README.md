## Hello ðŸ‘‹

# My name is Sylvie Doumet 

After a professional carrer in a whole other segment as a teacher and university researcher, I found that I am profoundly bound to design and arts, so I decide to restructure my professional skills in a new fulling way. Travelling abroad since yougest age and living in many different foreign countries has influenced my view on different cultural contexts, artistic traditions and gustos which I would like to integrate in my personal way of designing web sites. 
Inspiration through an exchange with artists, designers and web designers from different fields would be my aim. 
I would like to design websites for clothing companys, free artists, furniture and interior designers / and shops, and so on. At the same time I'm interessted in the creation of suitable apps for the same clients. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on becoming a web developer in a bootcamp.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS and Java. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on design matters in web development. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: slack / Sylvie Doumet
