## Hello 👋

# My name is Sylvie Doumet 

After a professional carrer in a whole other segment as a teacher and university researcher, I found that I am profoundly bound to design and arts, so I decide to restructure my professional skills in a new fulling way. Travelling abroad since yougest age, an living in many foreign countries have influence my view on different cultural contexts, which I would like to integrate in my personal way of designing web sites. Inspiration through an exchange with artists, designers and web designers from different fields would be my aim. So I would like to design websites for clothing companys, free artists, furniture and interior designers / and shops. At the same time I'm interessted in the creation of suitable apps for the same clients. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on becoming a web developer in a bootcamp.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Java. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on design matters in web development.
